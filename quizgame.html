    <p>I was born in Poway, CA, into a family of three, conisting of myself, my Polish/Canadian Mom, and my Assyrian Dad. When I was young, we moved back to Ontario, CA, for almost a year. The original reason we went to Canada, was to quickly get my moms passport renewed, however, it took a <b>bit</b> longer than we expected. While in Canada, we stayed at my Grandmas house, and while in Ottawa, the Capitol of Canada where we would get my moms passport renewed, we stayed in a Hotel.  year after being in Canada, we moved back to the United States, to join my dads part of the family. Currently, my moms family lives in Poland and Canada, and my dads family lives in the United States, mostly San Diego.</p>
    <h5>School:</h5>
    <p>I am currently a sophomore at Rancho Bernardo High School who plans to attend school at a University that provides a Commercial Aviation program. University of North Dakota or Montana University are my primary choices. As you read in my bio, I have been in awe of the Aviation world from a very young age. During University, I will be getting my flight hour in, and by the end of the 4 years, will have obtained my Commercial License. After University, I plan to move to Canada, specifically Ottawa, Montreal, or Toronto, and become a Commercial Pilot for Air Canada.</p></p>

    <p>During the summer, my dad, uncle, grandpa, and I took a trip to visit my uncle down in Puebla, Mexico. My uncle owns an industrial business that models and creates autmobile parts for contracted companies. During our time there, we visited Churchs, temples, parks, and most importantly, restaurants.
